## Who I Am  
I am a data engineer, people person, and coordinator. Optimization, personalization, and inclusion drives my work. As I tell my team members; data solutions are like clothes, take the measurements, fit it so it's useable, maintain the strucural integrity, and assure comfort. I believe data solutions must keep in mind any user, no matter background or situation. Ethical technological development is essential to ensure company success.

<br>
I love working with people, talking technology, company goals, or what recipe was a hit at dinner last night. My work outside of tech as well as my personal toolbox of communication skills allow me to facilitate constructive communication between teams to manage project goals. Adminstrative teams to IT departments, between campers on the playground, or parents to collegiate staff, coordinating constructive conversation is essential to a flourising work environment. 

## Current Goals 
I am seeking development opportunities with forward thinking organizations, eager to contribute in crafting elegant data solutions to solve data management roadblocks.
