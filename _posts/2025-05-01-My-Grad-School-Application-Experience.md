I spontaneously decided to apply to graduate school, with less than a month to complete it.  

You may be thinking, "Well that seems kind of rash, maybe a bit compulsive". Trust me, I know.  

It was a spontaneous decision, and I have no idea if it was the right decision. Regardless, I did it, and this is how it went.  

This journey began at the end of March 2025. Amidst job applications and self-paced online courses, I was emailing my professors, advisors, and other contacts seeking any kind of guidance. I was looking for a sign, something to jump out and shout at me "hey, you should do this"! A magical oracle to solve all my problems and tell me what's next.  

In the litany of replies, all very thoughtful and much appreciated, I was franticly digging for the 'sign' of what was the 'right thing to do'. One response caught my eye; a professor from college pointed me towards a data science graduate program at a local university. The deadline got extended from April 1st to May 1st, giving me a sliver of a chance to complete it in time.  She even knew some staff there, and they were kind enough to speak with me and give me some insight into the program to see if it aligned with my aspirations.  

That was my sign. The universe came down, grabbed me by the shoulders, and shoved me through the door. It was perfect. The courses, the staff, the research opportunities, I was salivating at the thought of being able to learn data ethics and analytics from such intelligent and thoughtful people. There was only one issue.  

I had to complete this application, and by this point I had 25 days to do it. 25 days to get references, transcripts, a graduate level resume, and ground my thoughts into reality. That would become my obsession for the entirety of April.  

And it was truly an obsession: actualizing my thoughts and feelings into words, collecting my experiences and qualifications, emailing peers to review my personal statements and resume, networking for references, contemplating my existence and purpose.  

Easy peasy lemon squeezy.  

As I got further along, I felt more and more sure that this was it, and this was awesome and fantastic and the perfect next step in my career. Then it was April 30th.  

### "Are you sure you want to do this?"
<br>
My brain froze at the submit button. Why was I suddenly panicking? I did all this work, why now am I doubting myself? I can’t back out now, I did so much. Why am I hesitating?  

I pressed the submit button; I should’ve felt excited, right? A bad aftertaste lingered in my mouth. It wasn’t dread, a dash of doubt, a hint of apprehension maybe? My head spun.  

What did I want to gain from graduate school? Why did I apply? To learn new things, get concrete experience in ethical technological development and new analytic skills of course, right? That’s what I wrote and what I told myself at least.   

It is interesting, that sentiment is still true. It is deeply true. Having the opportunity to go to graduate school and complete studies in data science would be an honor. But that bad aftertaste.   

It was shame.  

I don’t know why, logically this isn’t true, but applying for graduate school in my job hunt felt like a cop out. It felt like I failed to get a job, so I am going back to school to escape reality. Maybe that’s why I only told a handful of people, my mom, dad, and any peers that helped with my application. It took me time to name this emotion; this has never been evoked in me before. Why would submitting an application cause shame and embarassment?    

Nevertheless, it has been several days since I submitted my application. There hasn’t been any update on my status, and I don’t anticipate results for at least a few weeks. I write this not knowing my fate; I prefer it that way.   

Looking back, acknowledging the shame was a relief.  

While it may not sound like it, I am actually really proud of myself. I was able to sit down and create a, in my opinion, a well thought out application in less than 30 days. I made a decision to go for something I never did before and took the leap. It was challenging in many ways, and it restored confidence in me that I am capable of pushing myself in different ways.   

I haven’t tackled something out of my element in a long time, and while nerve wracking, it was invigorating! That adrenaline rush was epic, and I have taken that new hit of confidence and ran.   

That’s why this blog post exists, and why my website exists.   

All of this to say, I did it. It was a whirlwind. It made me question myself, my competency, and my sanity. I am so glad I did this, the growing pains were necessary, and now I can continue down the road to who-knows-where. Regardless, I am excited and grateful.   

Thanks for reading!
