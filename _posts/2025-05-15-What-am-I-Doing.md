### So what's the deal?
<br>
Based on what I titled this post, you’re probably thinking…  

Well, what am I doing? I can only assume - you can think whatever you like to be frank, I can’t read your mind.  

To be honest, I wanted to write about why I’m writing this blog.  

I forgot how much I enjoy writing. In school, writing really stressed me out. The timed essays, the pressure to perform, having to write something someone else chose for me, it was all dreadful. It was like dress shopping with my mom, somehow she always picked out the ugliest scratchiest dress in the entire store. Sorry mom.   

But I was kind of good at it, writing not shopping. If you looked at my report cards, I did best in history and English. Yet, I chose to study software development in college. To be fair I do love the problem-solving of coding, the organization, and being able to solve problems my own way. And the prospect of good pay and steady employment was nice. Funny how that works.   

What is pivotal is the moment I remembered, for all that I hated writing in school, when I wrote on my own volition, I really did enjoy it.   

Probably about a year and a half ago now, I was home looking through my childhood room for an old photo album. I didn’t find the album, but I did find my old journals.  

I have journals from elementary school through to early high school. They’re beat-up little books where I wrote what I did that day, my thoughts on events, class gossip. It was honestly quite charming, how my voice and style evolved through entries, no matter how short or mundane. As I flipped through fragile pages, I noticed the trend of my entries becoming more and more infrequent.  

It could be attributed to school getting more difficult. It could also be attributed to my anxiety around English class and writing or reading. Hindsight tells me it was school anxiety, not writing itself. My younger self couldn’t distinguish between the two. Quite tragic really.  

Like simple arithmetic, it all snapped together. Writing when I want, about what I want, with whatever linguistic pattern and language I like, was relieving to me. My brain constantly races with thoughts, letting some seep out onto paper is a relief.  

I started writing again; story ideas, concepts, emotions, gossip, themes I want to portray, anything. Everyone says journaling is therapeutic, for me it’s cathartic.   

That’s why I’m writing this blog. With renewed confidence, I want to write about how I feel in the moment, about whatever I want! Like a journal for myself of what I’ve accomplished and where I want to go. You won’t be getting personal secrets and gossip like my old journals; that’s just for me sadly.   

It’s awesome that my personal pursuits outside of the office can also benefit me careerwise. Practicing clear and creative communication in any medium can translate to any job, professional or otherwise. This reignited passion for writing is honestly helping me in every aspect of my life, that accomplishment and growth is definitely worthy of a blog post.  

In terms of what’s next, I plan to write about my professional progress, career progression, fill out my portfolio, personal insights, or whatever else I feel called to write about. I might share some more insight into my personal endeavors into longer form writing. Maybe short stories or even a novel someday? That would be exhilarating. Maybe I’ll make a page for my personal writing outside of this blogpost, maybe I will keep that to myself and just post updates on progress. Regardless, I am excited and revitalized about writing and wanted to share that here.  

Thank you for reading!
